                            "During the years leading up to 1936, two political parties built up enough political support to rival the likes of the Democrats and Republicans. These were the Socialist Party of America headed by John Reed and the America First Party headed by Huey Long. The SPA were supporters of Syndicalism and left leaning ideologies that advocated for the workers of America and wished to bring about a Syndicalist revolution, while the America First Party was a right leaning party formed by Huey Long in hopes of implementing the party’s Share Our Wealth program and were highly against the SPA. ",
                            "When Black Monday hit the US economy, a previously shot down bill reintroduced into the senate in hopes of its policies being able to alleviate the damage done by the Black Monday. The Garner-Wagner Bill was promised to be the bill that can help jump start economic recovery, however the bill had trouble gaining support in the senate due to conflicting interests between the SPA and AFP. With this, the Republicans and Democrats agreed to form a coalition government in order to counteract the rising influences of the SPA and AFP as well as having a better chance at maintaining order. This move was able to put more support behind the Garner-Wagner bill with further support gained by compromising with the SPA to modify the bill to include more worker friendly policies. Yet in the end the bill was shot down, angering both the AFP and SPA.",
                            "As months went on, violence within the nation began to dramatically rise. Influence for both the SPA and AFP began to grow as more senate seats were given to each respective party due to state elections. Violence between the SPA and AFP had gotten so high that the national guard were called in various states to help break up clashes between supporters. At the same time, cracks began to form within the Republican-Democrat coalition, but these rifts would be temporarily mended as the coalition focused on maintaining what power they have left within the states as the election of 1936 comes in. ",
                            "When November 1936 rolled around, the elections were mired with controversy, but none were more controversial as when the AFP candidate Huey Long wins the election. Immediately the SPA contested the results, citing voter fraud and refused to recognize the AFP’s victory. Now former president Herbert Hoover criticized the winner, saying that this choice would bring upon a dangerous future for the nation. In protest of the election results, the SPA declares a strike for New Years Day, crippling the US as the nation heads into 1938. After President Long’s inauguration his first orders were to ban the SPA from the government. Unsurprisingly this angered the SPA who refused to recognize his presidency. The SPA’s anger would only increase from here as one of president Long’s executive order was to label the SPA as a terrorist organisation, this was deemed unconstitutional by the SPA and was the last straw for the party, cutting all communication to Washington. The state of the US at this point was on the brink of collapse, in order to restore order, General MacArthur of the US Armed Forces marched on Washington DC to remove President Long on the grounds of being unable to perform the duties of a constitutional president. However, due to an informant in the military, President Long had already fled Washington, making his way down to Baton Rouge. MacArthur was later sworn in as provisional president until the nation can be stabilized. ",
                            "Yet the move to march on the capital would be the tipping point that would plunge the US into further fracturing along party lines. When President Long arrived in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he declared that MacArthur and the SPA were traitors and enemies to the US, and that states should side with him as he claimed to be the legitimate winner of the 1936 US elections. From this address the American Union State would be established and officially secede from the US. multiple states in the US deep south would pledge their allegiance to President long and the Union State, which included states from Texas to Alabama to South Carolina. ",
                            "The SPA would respond with a similar message, except directed towards Huey and MacArthur, in order to bring about the Syndicalist revolution, the SPA established the Combined Syndicates of America basing themselves out of Chicago. Several states along the Steel Belt pledged their allegiance to the CSA, joining with Chicago and seceding as well.",
                            "Seeing the threat that is upon the nation as well as an apparent subversion of the US’s democratic ideals, the Pacific states of California, Oregon, and Washington State declared that the SPA, AFP, and MacArthur in Washington were all enemies of the US and democracy, while not necessarily seceding from the US, the Sacramento lead Pacific States of America pledged that it will defeat the enemies in Baton Rouge, DC, and Chicago in order to save the US and preserve a true democracy. ",
                            "In response to the rebel states declaring their intentions, General MacArthur issued the 30 day deadline, an ultimatum to each rebel state to stand down and disarm before the federal government will have to intervene and force the rebels to disarm. Yet he and everyone knew that this ultimatum would fall upon deaf ears was the factions of America now face each other in a standoff as everyone tries to seize as much land as they can before open conflict begins.",
                            "The Standoff began with the CSA seizing control of Minnesota as Syndicalist militias march on Minneapolis. North Carolina would pledge its support for the Union State while Tennessee would be forcefully integrated by Longist militia. Federal forces secure New Jersey, kicking out syndicalist militias trying to take control to allow access to New York City. The Western states past the Mississippi that remained loyal to MacArthur in Washington stood their ground against any rebel state as the General vowed to protect them, but still every military installation was abandoned as the army moved east to fortify Virginia.  The states in the New England despite remaining loyal to Washington had secretly approached the Canadians to occupy New England as they did not want to endanger their people in the upcoming civil war. Meanwhile, Federal forces were forced out of Southern Texas and Iowa pledged its allegiance to the CSA. From there, the borders solidified and as the deadline comes to an end on the 3rd of April 1937, shots were fired across the nation as the Second American Civil War begins.",
                            "Acting on the wishes of the New England governors, the Canadians moved in and occupied New England, establishing the Provisional Republic of New England under the protection of Canada and the Entante. The three rebel nations scramble to grab as much of the west as they can as Washington  fortifies and holds their positions on the Appalachian mountains or Virginia and the northern borders of Maryland."
